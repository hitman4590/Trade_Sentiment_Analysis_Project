# Trade_Sentiment_Analysis_Project
The project I am presenting is made as an shortlisiting assignment I received from a company on internshala. Its  objective is to explore the relationship between trader performance and market  sentiment, uncover hidden patterns, and deliver insights that can drive smarter trading  strategies.

**The Required Strategies**

**Strategy-1**: Profitable Greed

                The "Greed" days offered the most and the highest profit to the users (~$87). The most profit giving coins were 'ARB' & 'PENDLE'. 
                
                When the index enters "Greed" Category, start fousing on the above mentioned profitable coins and open long positions. But beware of the extreme greedy states as the profit dives deep there.

**Strategy-2**: Extreme Fear Stage

                The dataset has No Trades On Extreme Fear Days. This shows that there is no profit when there is extreme fear according to the dataset. Any decision made by the buyers will not be made on historical data or so.

**Strategy-3**: Best Coin to BUY
    
                The SUI coin performs remarkably well during the fear stage (~$115) but falls drastically dring Greed stage. 

                Consider opening buy positions during fear stage
